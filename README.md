# GeoCam

[README en Español](README_es.md)

`GeoCam` converts [GeoShot](https://es.flightsim.to/file/83543/geoshot-refined-geotagged-screenshots) screenshots captured in `Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020` into `KML/KMZ` files for `Google Earth`, embedding location and flight data.

## ✨ Features

### Conversion
- Convert geotagged images into `KMZ`, `ZIP`, or a folder with the generated `KML`
- Optional recursive scan of subfolders
- Auto-open the output when conversion finishes

### Metadata
- Include aircraft, heading, speed, altitude, and location
- Choose whether altitude is shown in feet or meters
- Choose whether speed is shown in km/h or knots

### Presentation
- Select icon style for placemarks
- Control placemark size and scale

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020
- Google Earth (optional, to view the result)

## 🔧 Installation

- Download and extract `GeoCam` from the releases page
- Run `GeoCam.exe`

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Select the folder where your `MSFS` screenshots are stored
- Choose the options you want to include (aircraft, altitude, speed, heading, location)
- Pick an output (`KMZ`, `ZIP`, or folder)
- Open the result in `Google Earth`

## 📚 FAQ

**Q: What images can GeoCam convert?**  
A: It is built for `GeoShot` screenshots. Other images might work if they include the same geolocation data or follow the expected filename format.

**Q: Can I export to a folder instead of `KMZ`?**  
A: Yes. You can save to a folder or a `ZIP` file.

**Q: Do I need Google Earth installed?**  
A: Only to view the generated `KML/KMZ`.
